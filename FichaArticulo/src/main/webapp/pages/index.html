            Can machines think? This question is difficult to answer because the words ";machines" and "think" and even the word "can" are open to different interpretations. Alan Turing thought that the question was "too meaningless to deserve discussion" and suggested that we replace consideration of this question with a contest that is now called the "Turing Test."

            In a famous article published in 1950, Turing described an "imitation game" in which an interrogator tries to determine solely on the basis of a written interrogation of a man and a woman which is the man and which is the woman. The man in the imitation game tries to imitate a woman and answers the questions as he believes a woman would answer. Turing suggested that we apply the idea of the imitation game to computers and people.

            Nor does passing the Turing Test provide a logically
            sufficient condition for a computer to think or to be
            intelligent. For it is logically possible, though extremely
            unlikely, that a computer could pass the test by generating
            a random output of characters that just by
            chance happen to constitute perfectly good answers to
            the questions being asked. In such a situation the computer
            would pass the test but would not be intelligent.

            Could a human interrogator who uses a teletypewriter
            to communicate with a human and with a
            computer determine from the conversation which is
            the human and which is the computer respondent?
            The objective for the computer program in the game is
            to imitate a human. The computer might say that it had
            curly hair, liked chocolate ice cream, and preferred
            skiing to skating.

            Turing believed that the processes
            generating intelligent behavior could be understood in
            terms of computable functions, functions that his Turing
            machines could compute. Hence, Turing believed
            that an actual computer, if properly programmed, perhaps
            programmed to learn as a child does, might one
            day pass the test. Such a computer would produce
            verbal behavior that was indistinguishable from that of a
            human being. Turing did not give full details of his proposed
            test and variations are possible, but it is usually
            assumed that the interrogator is an intelligent human
            who asks numerous, penetrating questions and the
            human subject is a typical, normal, adult respondent.
